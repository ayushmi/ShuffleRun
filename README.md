# Introduction

So, our team had a huge problem; whenever we went for a run, our music never matched our pace. So we decided to fix this little problem.

Using Cut-throat HTML5 features like geolocation, filesystem and Web Audio, we've developed an HTML5 webapp which changes the music to match the speed at which you're running.

# Technologies Used
